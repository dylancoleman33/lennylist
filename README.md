# LENNY LIST
<br>

##Technologies Used 
I used Ruby on Rails to create the running application. I used HTML, CSS, and Google fonts to style and frame my site.

##MVP
* Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and at least one more that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with authentication. Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.
* Have full CRUD for at least one of your resources.
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
Be deployed online (Heroku) and accessible to the public. 

##Installation/Startup Instructions
My user will be able to create an account on the sign up page. Once the user has created an account, they are allowed to log in and add a new product with: Title, price of product, a description of the product, and a photo of the product. Once that is created, it will be displayed on the home/main page of the website. They are allowed create, read, update, and delete their product and use restful rooting. Once the user is done with their session, they are allowed to log out of their account. 

##Unsolved Problems 
* When created the price interger, the $ would not appear once the product was completed. 
* When deleting a product, the confirmation alert "Are you sure you want to delete" would not appear. 

##Next Steps 
* Before signing up, to make sure the user is in fact a millennial, they would have to pass a required test that would confirm that they are of age. If the user fails, they would be redirected to another page that would inform them that they are too old for the site. If the user passes, they would be redirected to the Sign Up page. 
* If the user is a seller, allow them to post more contact information so buyers can reach them easier. 
* Have the ability to post more pictures of the product the seller is trying to sell. 
* Adding a third model where users on the site are allowed to comment and "Like" posts.
